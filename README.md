# Class Comment Tracker

I made a tiny tool to make it easier to track my class participation. I find it more fun than updating a spreadsheet. Maybe you'll find it useful too.

## What it does

- Shows you the classes for the day
- Allows you to log your participation
- Mobile friendly so you can tap and move on

## Note

I made this in a few hours so it likely has a few bugs. I have not spent a lot of time on it and AI wrote a lot of it, so I did not fully audit everything.

Built for my classmates at Harvard Business School.
